Delete Record;
  Probably create a column in the db "deleted" instead of running an sql script to delete it(?)

Vehicle Index;
  Vehicle index for account customers which will make it easier  to browse all accounts for specific
  registrations, also make it so when account vehicles are inserted, it will automatically recognise
  the reg and place the company name in (handy for unknown trucks)

Global Search;
  A feature to search every record that is in the database that belongs to a specific reg, e.g "141MH123"
  the system will search for every entry that corresponds to that reg, it will make snap queries &
  other various checks easier and faster.

Notice Board;
  Exactly what the title says, a notice board for security to post too, mainly for problems etc.

Renewals System;
  A highlighting feature to mark renewals and more.
