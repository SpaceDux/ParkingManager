<h1>How do I check in?</h1>
<p>
  Once you arrive on-site, park up in our prebooking zone then make your way into the building and locate any of our self service parking terminals & simply type in your vehicle
  registration and follow the on-screen instructions, it's really that easy!
  <br><br>
  Alternatively you can seek assistance from a member of staff if you are unable to use the machine. Our staff will gladly assist you and guide you on how to use our terminals.

  <b>You must check in as soon as possible. If you fail to do so, our system may cancel your booking, resulting in a strike against your account. If you have 3 strikes, you'll be unable to book with us again.</b>

<h1>Can't make it? or later than expected?</h1>
<p>
  We all know the roads can be unpredictable, we offer you a grace time of <b>30 minutes on-top of your estimated time of arrival</b> to check in. Failing to check in within this window will result in your booking
  being cancelled and your account given a strike. 3 strikes will result in you being banned from our portal. <br>
  If you are running later than expected, please modify your booking and update your estimated time of arrival to match.<br>
  <br>
  However if you can't make it at all, please cancel your booking 30 minutes before your estimated time of arrival to prevent any strikes against your account.
